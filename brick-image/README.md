# brick-image

[![brick-image's Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/prikhi/brick-image.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/prikhi/hs-w3mimgdisplay "W3mImgDisplay on travis-ci.org")

This package lets you render raw images as
[Brick](https://github.com/jtdaugherty/brick) widgets using
[w3mimgdisplay](https://github.com/tats/w3m/blob/master/w3mimgdisplay.c).

You need to have `w3m` installed and `w3mimgdisplay` in your `$PATH`.

It is currently in a rough, buggy stage with an API that is still being worked
out.

For more information and an example application, see the [README in the
meta-repository](https://github.com/prikhi/hs-w3mimgdisplay).
